1.  Introduction

   Stateful Hash-Based Signature Schemes (S-HBS) such as HSS, XMSS and
   XMSS^MT combine Merkle trees with One Time Signatures (OTS) in order
   to provide digital signature schemes that remain secure even when
   quantum computers become available.  Their theoretic security is well
   understood and depends only on the security of the underlying hash
   function.  As such they can serve as an important building block for
   quantum computer resistant information and communication technology.

   The private key of S-HBS is a finite collection of OTS keys, hence
   only a limited number of messages can be signed and the private key's
   state must be updated and persisted after signing to prevent reuse of
   OTS keys.  While the right selection of algorithm parameters would
   allow a private key to sign a virtually unbounded number of messages
   (e.g. 2^60), this is at the cost of a larger signature size and
   longer signing time.  Due to the statefulness of the private key and
   the limited number of signatures that can be created, S-HBS might not
   be appropriate for use in interactive protocols.  However, in some
   use cases the deployment of S-HBS may be appropriate.  Such use cases
   are described and discussed later in Section 3.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Use Cases of S-HBS in X.509

   As many cryptographic algorithms that are considered to be quantum-
   resistant, S-HBS have several pros and cons regarding their practical
   usage.  On the positive side they are considered to be secure against
   a classical as well as a quantum adversary, and a secure
   instantiation of S-HBS may always be built as long as a
   cryptographically secure hash function exists.  Moreover, S-HBS offer
   small public key sizes, and, in comparison to other post-quantum
   signature schemes, the S-HBS can offer relatively small signature
   sizes (for certain parameter sets).  While key generation and
   signature generation may take longer than classical alternatives,
   fast and minimal verification routines can be built.  The major
   negative aspect is the statefulness.  Private keys always have to be
   handled in a secure manner, S-HBS necessitate a special treatment of
   the private key in order to avoid security incidents like signature
   forgery [MCGREW], [SP800208].  Therefore, for S-HBS, a secure
   environment MUST be used for key generation and key management.

   Note that, in general, root CAs offer such a secure environment and
   the number of issued signatures (including signed certificates and
   CRLs) is often moderate due to the fact that many root CAs delegate
   OCSP services or the signing of end-entity certificates to other
   entities (such as subordinate CAs) that use stateless signature
   schemes.  Therefore, many root CAs should be able to handle the
   required state management, and S-HBS offer a viable solution.

   As the above reasoning for root CAs usually does not apply for
   subordinate CAs, it is NOT RECOMMENDED for subordinate CAs to use
   S-HBS for issuing end-entity certificates.  Moreover, S-HBS MUST NOT
   be used for end-entity certificates.

   However, S-HBS MAY be used for code signing certificates, since they
   are suitable and recommended in such non-interactive contexts.  For
   example, see the recommendations for software and firmware signing in
   [CNSA2.0].  Some manufactures use common and well-established key
   formats like X.509 for their code signing and update mechanisms.
   Also there are multi-party IoT ecosystems where publicly trusted code
   signing certificates are useful.

4.  Algorithm Identifiers and Parameters

   In this document, we define new OIDs for identifying the different
   stateful hash-based signature algorithms.  An additional OID is
   defined in [I-D.draft-ietf-lamps-rfc8708bis] and repeated here for
   convenience.  For all of the OIDs, the parameters MUST be absent.

4.1.  HSS Algorithm Identifier

   The object identifier and public key algorithm identifier for HSS is
   defined in [I-D.draft-ietf-lamps-rfc8708bis].  The definitions are
   repeated here for reference.

   The object identifier for an HSS public key is id-alg-hss-lms-
   hashsig:

   id-alg-hss-lms-hashsig  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
      iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs9(9)
      smime(16) alg(3) 17 }

   Note that the id-alg-hss-lms-hashsig algorithm identifier is also
   referred to as id-alg-mts-hashsig.  This synonym is based on the
   terminology used in an early draft of the document that became
   [RFC8554].

   The public key and signature values identify the hash function and
   the height used in the HSS/LMS tree.  [RFC8554] and [SP800208] define
   these values, but an IANA registry [IANA-LMS] permits the
   registration of additional identifiers in the future.

4.2.  XMSS Algorithm Identifier

   The object identifier for an XMSS public key is id-alg-xmss-hashsig:

   id-alg-xmss-hashsig  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
      TBD }

   The public key and signature values identify the hash function and
   the height used in the XMSS tree.  [RFC8391] and [SP800208] define
   these values, but an IANA registry [IANA-XMSS] permits the
   registration of additional identifiers in the future.

4.3.  XMSS^MT Algorithm Identifier

   The object identifier for an XMSS^MT public key is id-alg-xmssmt-
   hashsig:

   id-alg-xmssmt-hashsig  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
      TBD }

   The public key and signature values identify the hash function and
   the height used in the XMSS^MT tree.  [RFC8391] and [SP800208] define
   these values, but an IANA registry [IANA-XMSS] permits the
   registration of additional identifiers in the future.

5.  Public Key Identifiers

   Certificates conforming to [RFC5280] can convey a public key for any
   public key algorithm.  The certificate indicates the algorithm
   through an algorithm identifier.  An algorithm identifier consists of
   an OID and optional parameters.

   [RFC8554] and [RFC8391] define the raw octet string encodings of the
   public keys used in this document.  When used in a
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo type, the subjectPublicKey BIT STRING contains
   the raw octet string encodings of the public keys.

   This document defines ASN.1 OCTET STRING types for encoding the
   public keys when not used in a SubjectPublicKeyInfo.  The OCTET
   STRING is mapped to a subjectPublicKey (a value of type BIT STRING)
   as follows: the most significant bit of the OCTET STRING value
   becomes the most significant bit of the BIT STRING value, and so on;
   the least significant bit of the OCTET STRING becomes the least
   significant bit of the BIT STRING.

5.1.  HSS Public Keys

   The HSS public key identifier is as follows:

   pk-HSS-LMS-HashSig PUBLIC-KEY ::= {
      IDENTIFIER id-alg-hss-lms-hashsig
      -- KEY no ASN.1 wrapping --
      PARAMS ARE absent
      CERT-KEY-USAGE
         { digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyCertSign, cRLSign } }

   The HSS public key is defined as follows:

   HSS-LMS-HashSig-PublicKey ::= OCTET STRING

   [RFC8554] defines the raw octet string encoding of an HSS public key
   using the hss_public_key structure.  See [SP800208] and [RFC8554] for
   more information on the contents and format of an HSS public key.
   Note that the single-tree signature scheme LMS is instantiated as HSS
   with number of levels being equal to 1.

5.2.  XMSS Public Keys

   The XMSS public key identifier is as follows:

   pk-XMSS-HashSig PUBLIC-KEY ::= {
      IDENTIFIER id-alg-xmss-hashsig
      -- KEY no ASN.1 wrapping --
      PARAMS ARE absent
      CERT-KEY-USAGE
         { digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyCertSign, cRLSign } }

   The XMSS public key is defined as follows:

   XMSS-HashSig-PublicKey ::= OCTET STRING

   [RFC8391] defines the raw octet string encoding of an HSS public key
   using the xmss_public_key structure.  See [SP800208] and [RFC8391]
   for more information on the contents and format of an XMSS public
   key.

5.3.  XMSS^MT Public Keys

   The XMSS^MT public key identifier is as follows:

   pk-XMSSMT-HashSig PUBLIC-KEY ::= {
      IDENTIFIER id-alg-xmssmt-hashsig
      -- KEY no ASN.1 wrapping --
      PARAMS ARE absent
      CERT-KEY-USAGE
         { digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyCertSign, cRLSign } }

   The XMSS^MT public key is defined as follows:

   XMSSMT-HashSig-PublicKey ::= OCTET STRING

   [RFC8391] defines the raw octet string encoding of an HSS public key
   using the xmssmt_public_key structure.  See [SP800208] and [RFC8391]
   for more information on the contents and format of an XMSS^MT public
   key.

6.  Key Usage Bits

   The intended application for the key is indicated in the keyUsage
   certificate extension [RFC5280].  When one of the
   AlgorithmIdentifiers specified in this document appears in the
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo field of a certification authority (CA) X.509
   certificate [RFC5280], the certificate key usage extension MUST
   contain at least one of the following values: digitalSignature,
   nonRepudiation, keyCertSign, or cRLSign.  However, it MUST NOT
   contain other values.

   When one of these AlgorithmIdentifiers appears in the
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo field of an end entity X.509 certificate
   [RFC5280], the certificate key usage extension MUST contain at least
   one of the following values: digitalSignature or nonRepudiation.
   However, it MUST NOT contain other values.

   Note that for certificates that indicate id-alg-hss-lms-hashsig the
   above definitions are more restrictive than the requirement defined
   in Section 4 of [I-D.draft-ietf-lamps-rfc8708bis].

7.  Signature Algorithms

   This section identifies OIDs for signing using HSS, XMSS, and
   XMSS^MT.  When these algorithm identifiers appear in the algorithm
   field as an AlgorithmIdentifier, the encoding MUST omit the
   parameters field.  That is, the AlgorithmIdentifier SHALL be a
   SEQUENCE of one component, one of the OIDs defined in the following
   subsections.

   When the signature algorithm identifiers described in this document
   are used to create a signature on a message, no digest algorithm is
   applied to the message before signing.  That is, the full data to be
   signed is signed rather than a digest of the data.

   For HSS, the signature value is described in section 6.4 of
   [RFC8554].  For XMSS and XMSS^MT the signature values are described
   in sections B.2 and C.2 of [RFC8391], respectively.  The octet string
   representing the signature is encoded directly in the OCTET STRING
   without adding any additional ASN.1 wrapping.  For the Certificate
   and CertificateList structures, the signature value is wrapped in the
   "signatureValue" OCTET STRING field.

7.1.  HSS Signature Algorithm

   The HSS public key OID is also used to specify that an HSS signature
   was generated on the full message, i.e. the message was not hashed
   before being processed by the HSS signature algorithm.

   id-alg-hss-lms-hashsig OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
      iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs9(9)
      smime(16) alg(3) 17 }

   The HSS signature is defined as follows:

   HSS-LMS-HashSig-Signature ::= OCTET STRING

   See [SP800208] and [RFC8554] for more information on the contents and
   format of an HSS signature.

7.2.  XMSS Signature Algorithm

   The XMSS public key OID is also used to specify that an XMSS
   signature was generated on the full message, i.e. the message was not
   hashed before being processed by the XMSS signature algorithm.

   id-alg-xmss-hashsig  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
      TBD }

   The XMSS signature is defined as follows:

   XMSS-HashSig-Signature ::= OCTET STRING

   See [SP800208] and [RFC8391] for more information on the contents and
   format of an XMSS signature.

   The signature generation MUST be performed according to 7.2 of
   [SP800208].

7.3.  XMSS^MT Signature Algorithm

   The XMSS^MT public key OID is also used to specify that an XMSS^MT
   signature was generated on the full message, i.e. the message was not
   hashed before being processed by the XMSS^MT signature algorithm.

   id-alg-xmssmt-hashsig  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
      TBD }

   The XMSS^MT signature is defined as follows:

   XMSSMT-HashSig-Signature ::= OCTET STRING

   See [SP800208] and [RFC8391] for more information on the contents and
   format of an XMSS^MT signature.

   The signature generation MUST be performed according to 7.2 of
   [SP800208].

8.  Key Generation

   The key generation for XMSS and XMSS^MT MUST be performed according
   to 7.2 of [SP800208]

9.  ASN.1 Module

   For reference purposes, the ASN.1 syntax is presented as an ASN.1
   module here.  This ASN.1 Module builds upon the conventions
   established in [RFC5911].

10.  Security Considerations

   The security requirements of [SP800208] MUST be taken into account.

   For S-HBS it is crucial to stress the importance of a correct state
   management.  If an attacker were able to obtain signatures for two
   different messages created using the same OTS key, then it would
   become computationally feasible for that attacker to create forgeries
   [BH16].  As noted in [MCGREW] and [ETSI-TR-103-692], extreme care
   needs to be taken in order to avoid the risk that an OTS key will be
   reused accidentally.  This is a new requirement that most developers
   will not be familiar with and requires careful handling.

   Various strategies for a correct state management can be applied:

   *  Implement a track record of all signatures generated by a key pair
      associated to a S-HBS instance.  This track record may be stored
      outside the device which is used to generate the signature.  Check
      the track record to prevent OTS key reuse before a new signature
      is released.  Drop the new signature and hit your PANIC button if
      you spot OTS key reuse.

   *  Use a S-HBS instance only for a moderate number of signatures such
      that it is always practical to keep a consistent track record and
      be able to unambiguously trace back all generated signatures.

   *  Apply the state reservation strategy described in Section 5 of
      [MCGREW], where upcoming states are reserved in advance by the
      signer.  In this way the number of state synchronisations between
      nonvolatile and volatile memory is reduced.

11.  Backup and Restore Management

   Certificate Authorities have high demands in order to ensure the
   availability of signature generation throughout the validity period
   of signing key pairs.

   Usual backup and restore strategies when using a stateless signature
   scheme (e.g.  SLH-DSA) are to duplicate private keying material and
   to operate redundant signing devices or to store and safeguard a copy
   of the private keying material such that it can be used to set up a
   new signing device in case of technical difficulties.

   For S-HBS such straightforward backup and restore strategies will
   lead to OTS reuse with high probability as a correct state management
   is not guaranteed.  Strategies for maintaining availability and
   keeping a correct state are described in Section 7 of [SP800208].

12.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a module OID from the "SMI for PKIX
   Module Identifier" registry for the ASN.1 module in Section 9.
